Shopping is getting goods or services from a seller with the purpose of purchasing at that time. People often waste time, and effort searching for specific products by visiting various stores at a time, resulting in a poor shopping experience and a decrease in customer interest in finding or purchasing the product locally. Therefore, there is a need for a more effective, efficient, and convenient way to access the market of products.

    
An application will be developed using object detection technology to scan products and provide locations along with a map to navigate to the store, aimed at helping consumers find products from various businesses with ease. This application serves as a tool for empowerment that benefits both consumers and businesses by enabling consumers to quickly and easily find the products they need while helping small and medium-sized businesses to reach a wider audience and expand their operations.

<!-- Feature -->
## Main Feature :bulb:
Swalokal has the key feature of being able to detect products through the device's camera or images from the gallery. The product image will be detected to find out where the product is sold based on the user's location (closest to the user). Users can select one of the stores listed on the map to display related information, and there is also a route feature to direct users to the store.
